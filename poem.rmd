## "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!


  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"

  Long time the manxome foe he sought --  
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,  
  And stood awhile in thought.

## Second Verse
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
 And sorry I could not travel both
 And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
